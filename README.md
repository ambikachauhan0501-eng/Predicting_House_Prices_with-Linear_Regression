# Predicting_House_Prices_with-Linear_Regression

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate house prices based on relevant features.  
This project provides hands‑on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.


## Key Concepts and Challenges
- **Data Collection:** Obtain dataset with numerical features and target variable.  
- **Data Exploration & Cleaning:** Handle missing values and ensure data quality.  
- **Feature Selection:** Identify relevant predictors.  
- **Model Training:** Implement linear regression using Scikit‑learn.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics like Mean Squared Error and R‑squared.  
- **Visualization:** Show predicted vs actual values.  

##  Learning Objectives
- Understand linear regression concepts.  
- Gain practical experience in predictive modeling.  
- Learn model evaluation and interpretation skills.  

##  Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit‑learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

##  How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
